# PFOR_FFMPEG

## Purpose

This is a collection of various experiments I have done with FFMPEG - http://www.ffmpeg.org/

All scripts are:

- made for video input and/or output
- command-line based
- developed on Windows, but they should work on *nix too.
- work with a recent version of ffmpeg (e.g. for use of the [-vf video filter](http://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-filters.html) option).
- I use the following version:  
> ffmpeg version **N-56663-g851a6e2** Copyright (c) 2000-2013 the FFmpeg developers

> built on **Sep 25 2013** 18:08:26 with gcc 4.8.1 (GCC)

- generic libraries are in folder `lib/`

## Some experiments

- *thermography* - to convert B/W IR videos into thermographic colours
- *instagramify* - to convert normal (low quality/phone) videos into more interesting versions, with Instagram-like effects
